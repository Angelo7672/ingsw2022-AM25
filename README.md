The project is the final test of the Software Engineering course held at Politecnico di Milano <br> 
**Final Score**: 30/30 cum laude <br> <br>
It consists of a Java version of the board game [*Eriantys*](https://www.craniocreations.it/prodotto/eriantys/), by CranioCreations (the rules of the game can be found [here](https://www.craniocreations.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Eriantys_ITA_bassa.pdf)). <br>
This repository includes the source code of the game and of the unity tests, and the executable versione of the game (.jar), plus all the information regarding the implementation.
